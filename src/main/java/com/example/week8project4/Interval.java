/*
The first class should be a generic class Interval defined for any
type that implements the Comparable interface.
Objects of this type have a start and end of the generic type parameter that defines
the start and end of the interval.
The class should be immutable, so it should have no setter methods. At a minimum, it should
contain the following public methods:
* A constructor that accepts the start and end of an interval and constructs an Interval object
* A method within that is supplied an object of the generic type parameter and returns
    whether that object is inside the interval, including the endpoints
* A method subinterval that is passed an interval as a parameter and returns whether the
    interval parameter is a subinterval, completely within, the interval on which the method is invoked
*A method overlaps that is passed an interval as a parameter and returns whether the
    interval parameter overlaps the interval on which the method is invoked
